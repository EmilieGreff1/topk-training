# TopK Training GAN

This repository contains an implementation of the TopK Training GAN based on the research paper Top-k Training of GANs: [Improving GAN Performance by Throwing Away Bad Samples](https://arxiv.org/abs/2002.06224). 

The TopK Training GAN is a novel approach in the field of Generative Adversarial Networks (GANs) that introduces a mechanism to control the quality and diversity of generated samples.

## Introduction

The TopK Training GAN is a modification of the traditional GAN architecture that incorporates a ranking mechanism during the training process. By introducing a top-K selection strategy for discriminator updates, the TopK Training GAN focuses on enhancing the quality and diversity of generated samples.

This implementation aims to provide an accessible and efficient implementation of the TopK Training GAN algorithm, allowing researchers and developers to experiment with this technique and compare it with other GAN approaches.
